	                <p><strong>Less obvious perks of using 'live' data resources include logins and payments. How could Twitter be used in these two scenarios?</strong></p>
	                <p>Twitter accounts could be linked with other accounts as a verified form of identity. Linking social media accounts such as Twitter with other logins and payment accounts creates an ease of use, and on over all more simplistic way to manage several different accounts.  I personally log into several different websites and forums with my Facebook profile.  It is definitely easier to manage one login and password.  Security plays a big role in the matter, and linking a Twitter account would add that extra layer of security over that particular site.</p>
	                <p><strong>Visit Programmableweb.com and search for JSON-P data sources. Why would we need JSON-P, specifically?</strong></p>
	                <p>JSON with padding allows us to request data from a server located in a different domain than the one the application is located in.  This is typically not allowed due to the same origin policy.  The data obtained is in the form of JavaScript code and is evaluated by a JavaScript interpreter, eliminating the need for a JSON parser.</p>
	                <p><strong>Based on the JSON-P search results: what data resource(s) do you think might pair well with which types of Native device features?</strong></p>

					<p><strong>Briefly describe some past 'lessons learned' regarding workflow as it relates to research, design, development, etc.</strong></p>
					<p>One major lesson I have learned has to do with time management.  We live in a busy world, and I'm sure all of us have responsibilities outside of school.  It is important to maintain a good schedule and try to lay out a 
						good plan on when you'll have time to work on projects. Research is key when developing, and laying out a plan for anything that you do.  It's also a good idea to get opinions from your peers and test markets targeted for your applications.e</p>

	                <h4>Accessibility</h4>
	                <p><strong>What are some of the ways that you could change your HTML on your Demo app to be more accessible? (Remember, you can use the Section tag with jQuery, for instance)</strong></p>
	                <p>There are several different things that can be done to the HTML to make it more accessible.  One thing would be to adjust the colors to be more friendly to those that suffer from color blindness.  Another thing that could be done is to add contextual links for those that use screen readers.  Alternative content is also a good idea (ie. large print; symbols; or simpler language). Alt text can also be added to be read aloud to the user, and for search engines to store info about a page.</p>
	                <p><strong>Visit a video service on the web (like YouTube) and search for "Screen Reader Demo" and "Mobile Screen Reader" - what are some of the common frustrations (or common support mechanisms) that you see among the examples that are given - how could you fix them (or use them)?</strong></p>
	                <p>Several issues seem to arise with these types of accessibility features.  Many seem a bit cumbersome to learn and use, and seem to have many problems fully navigating pages.  Linear navigation also seems to be a problem.  Obviously, if HTML isn't marked up correctly, screen readers will have trouble, and may be incomprehensible on certain website or mobile sites.
		               Making sure that HTML is properly formatted and written correctly will help with screen reading. </p>
	                <p><strong>Devices: Please list two devices (and some of their features) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</strong></p>
	                <ul>
		                <li>Kindle Fire HD - Text-to-Speech; Voice Guide; Explore by Touch; Orientation Lock</li>
		                <li>Samsung Galaxy Tab - Speak passwords; TalkBack; Text-to-speech; Enchanced Web accessibility</li>
	                </ul>
	                <p><strong>Mobile Apps: Please list two apps (either Android or iOS, or both) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</strong></p>
	                <p>I've been thinking about this quite a bit.  As of right now, I would definitely like to add Fantasy Football functionality to track my Fantasy Football League and team this season.  I'd like to pull league messages and updates down from Fox as well as player information

                <div data-role="collapsible" class="research">
	                <h4>Industry Research</h4>
	                <p><strong>What are the 'top selling' app categories in the U.S.? Japan? Great Britain?</strong></p>
	                <p>From what I've researched, and as stated by the Distimo 2012 Year in review, the most downloaded apps are games at 33%, followed by widgets at 8%; entertainment apps at 7%; social apps at 5%, and other categories falling below that line.<br>
						Other sites have show that games still top the list, followed by productivity and camera/editing applications.<br>
						The top 20 iOS Publishers in Japan last year by revenue all make mobile games with the exception of two developers.<br>
						Mobile gaming tops the list again when researching top mobile applications for 2012 in the United Kingdom.</p>
					<p><strong>Based on your three answers above, what might you infer about each of the markets listed?</strong></p>
					<p>From the research I have done; it would seem wise to invest more time into developing entertaining and engaging mobile applications centered around gaming.  It has been stated before that a person generally uses a mobile application on a micro-break, and simple games designed for this type of activity seem to fair pretty well in the marketplace.</p>
					<p><strong>What is the average cost and bandwidth limits per user (in general) in each of the three markets? How may this impact development?</strong></p>
					<p>The costs and bandwidth limits differ extensively between the three markets.  Japan has the lowest cost per 2GB/month of data at right around $12.  The United Kingdom comes in second at right around $25/month.  The United States tops the list worldwide for cost of 2GB/month of data at right around $40. <br>
						In relation; Japan's bandwidth limits are much higher than that of the United Kingdom and the USA.</p>
					<p><strong>And, finally, what would be your suggested strategy in project topic and global market choice? Feel free to have a first and second choice.</strong></p>
					<p>My first choice would probably be to develop a high end mobile game targeted towards the Japanese market.  Due to their high bandwidth limits and relatively low costs for bandwidth, I think a mobile RPG game would really do well.  Something along the lines of a World of Warcraft or EverQuest type game built for mobile.<br>
						My second choice would be to develop a streamlined and relatively small and catchy mobile game for the US market.  It is very apparent that simple games do really well on the App Store.  Candy Crush Saga is one case in point.  Fun applications with in-app purchases and advertising seem to make very good profits.</p>
